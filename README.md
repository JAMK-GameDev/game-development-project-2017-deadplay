**Morbituary** is a co-operative dungeon crawler, in which two players defeat enemies, solve minor puzzles and figure out ways to pass beyond obstacles to progress from floor to floor. The multiplayer would be only local, with both of the players able to control their characters with just the keyboard and mouse. The game will be presented in a top-down angle.
